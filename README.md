# :postbox: About Me
My name is Yeifran Martinez and I am a Computer Science student at Queens College in New York!

I am a passionate coder with a strong interest in both Full Stack development and AI/Machine Learning. My journey into the world of coding began with creating small plugins for Minecraft and Roblox, which sparked a deeper fascination with programming. Over time, this interest expanded into developing fun and engaging websites for my friends. My enthusiasm for coding continues to grow as I explore new technologies and challenges in these fields.
